# libdvdread
libdvdread provides a simple foundation for reading DVD video disks. It provides the functionality that is required to access many DVDs. It parses IFO files, reads NAV-blocks, and performs CSS authentication and descrambling (if an external libdvdcss library is installed). http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/
